In a classification problem we want to classify or label a new observation, having trained our model with a set of observations whose class is known.<!--more--> One approach is to think that all elements that belong to the same class are *similar* in some way. We thus need a concept of similarity or *distance*.

For example, if we had a box of apples and we wanted to classify based on color, we would like our model to take the apples as input, the new observation being taking an apple from the box and checking its color, and give us its label as output. For example, **1** could be *red apple*, and **0** could be *green apple*. We then have two classes, 1 and 0. Some apples though, are not entirely red or green, and it's hard to say if they should be labeled 1 or 0. Here's where the concept of distance comes to help. Simply speaking, if the apple is sufficiently green, or more green than red, our model should label it as 0.

How does the model know what's green or red to begin with? We need to train our model on apples we know for sure are red or green. Applying the concept of distance to a new apple that we pick from the box, we can compare the new apple with the previously observed green and red apples.


## Kernels


In general, rather than apples we have objects $$x$$, belonging to a space $$\mathcal{X}$$. Our concept of similarity is embodied by a function $$\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$$ that we call Kernel Function. It is a measure of the distance between $$x$$ and $$y$$. It is natural to choose a kernel that is symmetric ($$κ(x,y)=κ(y,x)κ(x,y)=κ(y,x)$$), that is, the similarity or distance between $$x$$ and $$y$$ is the same as the distance between $$y$$  and $$x$$, and non-negative ($$κ(x,y)\geq 0$$), but it doesn't need be.

Two popular choices are the Gaussian kernel,
\begin{equation}
\kappa(x,x′) = \exp\bigg(−\dfrac{1}{2}(x−x′)^T\,\Sigma^{−1}\,(x−x′)\bigg),
\end{equation}
and the squared exponential, radial basis function (RBF),
\begin{equation}
\kappa(x,x′) = \exp\bigg(−\dfrac{||x−x′||}2{\sigma^2}\bigg).
\end{equation}
Of course there are many different kernels for different uses. Another choice worth mentioning is the Matern Kernel.
Notice in the last formula how the parameter $$\sigma$$ influences the smoothness of the kernel. In other words, $$\sigma$$ controls how far away points "influence" our current point. if it is large, we allow points far away from the current point to be "taken into account" (correlate). If it is small, only points close to the current point will count.


Let's make an example where we draw samples from a gaussian process with the squared exponential kernel. Don't worry about the gaussian process part for now. In the first picture $$\sigma=5$$ while in the second $$\sigma=2$$. The difference in the smoothness of the curves is clear.


```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats as stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


sample_size = 200
x_test = np.linspace(-50, 50, sample_size)


def _kernel_fun(x, y, s):
    """ Computes the kernel function for two points x and y. """
    return np.exp(-(1.0 / (2 * s ** 2)) * abs(x - y) ** 2)


def kernel_matrix(x1, x2, s):
    """ Computes the kernel matrix. It's symmetric. """
    h = 0
    K = np.empty((sample_size, sample_size))
    for j in xrange(sample_size):  # fill the j-th column
        for i in xrange(0, sample_size):
            K[i][j] = _kernel_fun(x1[i], x2[j], s)
        h = h + 1
    triu = np.triu_indices(4)
    K[triu] = K.T[triu]
    return K


K5 = kernel_matrix(np.asarray(x_test), np.asarray(x_test), 5)  # high sigma (=5), smoother functions
K2 = kernel_matrix(np.asarray(x_test), np.asarray(x_test), 2)  # low sigma (=2), not so smooth

# Sample from the multivariate normal process with mean zero and cov=K
gauss_samples5 = np.random.multivariate_normal(np.zeros((sample_size, 1)).ravel(), K5, size=5)
gauss_samples2 = np.random.multivariate_normal(np.zeros((sample_size, 1)).ravel(), K2, size=5)

plt.figure(figsize=(17,6))
plt.plot(gauss_samples5.T)
plt.title("Samples from Multivariate Normal $\sigma$ = 5")
plt.show()
plt.figure(figsize=(17,6))
plt.plot(gauss_samples2.T)
plt.title("Samples from Multivariate Normal $\sigma$ = 2")
plt.show()

## A Few Mathematical Details


There is plenty of material on books and internet about the background theory. I'm just giving a hint to fix some concepts, after all, this is a gentle introduction. *Feel free to skip this section* if you're more example oriented. Those really intrested in (the very intresting) theory can check the literature. I recommend the book written by <a target="_blank" href='http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/index.html'>Kevin P. Murphy</a>. Other resources are the well written lectures by D. Sejdinovic and A. Gretton <a target="_blank" href='http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~sejdinov/teaching/atml14/Theory_2014.pdf'>right here</a> and <a target="_blank" href='http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/lecture4_introToRKHS.pdf'> here </a>.

## Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space

We start with two fundamental steps
1. Let's consider a bounded functional over the Hilbert space $$\mathcal{H}$$ of functions $$f$$, that is,  $$\mathcal{L}_x:f \rightarrow f(x)$$.  Notice that the functional $$\mathcal{L}_x$$ is somehow special, it evaluates the function at point $$x$$. 
2. If the evaluation is bounded, that is if $$\mathcal{L}_x$$ is a continuous functional $$\forall x\in\mathcal{X}$$, then $$\mathcal{H}$$ is a **reproducing kernel Hilbert space** (RKHS) by definition. 

Thanks to Riesz theorem, we know that bounded linear functionals defined in a Hilbert space $$\mathcal{H}$$, can be represented in a unique way with the inner product in $$\mathcal{H}$$, that is, $$\forall f \in \mathcal{H}$$ there is a unique $$\kappa_x=\kappa(\cdot, x) \in \mathcal{H}, \forall x \in \mathcal{X}$$, such that  $$\mathcal{L}[f]=\langle f,\kappa_x\rangle_H$$, where the brackets represent the inner product in $$\mathcal{H}$$. 

We now ask $$\kappa_x$$ to have the fundamental *reproducing property* 
\begin{equation}
\forall x \in \mathcal{X},\forall f\in\mathcal{H},\;\;\langle f,\kappa(\cdot, x) \rangle_{\mathcal{H}} = f(x).
\end{equation}
Such $$\kappa_x$$ is the **reproducing kernel** of the Hilbert space $$\mathcal{H}$$. As the name suggests, it allows us to "evaluate" $$f$$ at $$x$$, $$f$$ being the "input" function and $$f(x)$$ being the output of the inner product. It is made of two "ingredients", the reproducing property above, and the fact that $$\kappa(\cdot, x) \in \mathcal{H}, \forall x \in \mathcal{X}$$.

Since $$\kappa(\cdot, x)\in \mathcal{H}, \forall x\in\mathcal{X}$$, we can exploit the reproducing property and write
that, $$\forall x, y\in \mathcal{X}$$
\begin{equation}
\kappa(x,y)=\langle \kappa(\cdot, x), \kappa(\cdot, y)\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}.
\end{equation}

#### Recap

So far we have defined the RKHS as a Hilbert space with funcionals that "reproduce" a function $$f$$ in a continuous way. We then went on to characterize such functionals. Thanks to Reisz theorem we represent such functionals in a unique way with the inner product in $$\mathcal{H}$$, which led us to define the *reproducing kernel*, $$\kappa:\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$$.

Thus, given a RKHS $$\mathcal{H}$$, we can define a reproducing kernel $$\kappa$$ associated with $$\mathcal{H}$$. Moreover, such kernel is *unique* and *positive definite*. The positive definiteness means that the matrix $$\mathbf{K}$$ with elements $$K_{i,j}=\kappa(x_i,x_j)$$, is positive definite. 

## Features

We can adopt another point of view and ask ourselves what is in general a *kernel*. We can **define** a kernel to be a function $$\kappa:\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ if there exists a Hilbert space $$\mathcal{H}$$ and a **feature map**, $$\phi(x):\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{H},$$ such that, $$\forall x,y\in\mathcal{X}:$$

\begin{equation}
\kappa(x,y)=\langle \phi(x),\phi(y) \rangle_{\mathcal{H}}.
\end{equation}

*Every reproducing kernel can be represented with an inner product of feature maps.* We have reached the conclusion that we can represent a reproducing kernel in a RKHS with the formula above.

### Summary

We have seen that every RKHS has a unique reproducing kernel which is also positive definite. Such kernel can be represented with the inner product of the RKHS. We add one piece to the puzzle. Thanks to <a target="_blank" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space#Moore.E2.80.93Aronszajn_theorem'> Moore-Aronszain</a> theorem, every positive definite kernel is a reproducing kernel.

Given a RKHS, $$\mathcal{H}$$ $$\Rightarrow$$ it is possible to define a reproducing kernel with the inner product in $$\mathcal{H}$$

$$\forall$$ positive definite kernel $$\Rightarrow$$ it is a reproducing kernel $$\Rightarrow$$ there is a unique RKHS with $$\kappa$$ being its reproducing kernel.

## Decisions. Optimal Separating Hyperplane

Sounds good? I know it's a lot of stuff and we just skimmed the surface! That was perhaps sufficient to trigger your interest and raise some questions.

To fix the ideas,let us consider the feature vector with N elements/features: $$\Phi(x)=[x_1,x_2,x_3,…]$$. If we were classifying cars, for example, the features could be, car weight, year of production, engine power. Cars could be hard to classify based on these features. What if we add another feature, that is, *increase the dimension* of the feature space? This feature doesn't even have to be real, it's used to increase the discriminative power of our algorithm since the features that we have are "insufficient", i.e. our data looks like in the figures below.


```python
import numpy as np
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

N = 10
x1 = np.random.uniform(0, 2, N)
x2 = np.random.uniform(0, 3, N)

plt.figure()
plt.plot(x1, x2, '.b')
plt.plot(2,3,'.r')
plt.xlabel('x1')
plt.ylabel('x2')
plt.title('Figure 1')
plt.show()

# What if we add a feature?
x3 = np.hstack((np.zeros(N/2), np.ones(N/2)))

fig = plt.figure()
ax = Axes3D(fig)
ax.scatter(x1, x2, x3, c='b')
ax.scatter(2,3,1,c='r')  # Plot a red point for reference
# Plot a surface
# p = fig.gca()
# X, Y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(0, 1, 0.1) * 2, np.arange(0, 1, 0.1) * 3)
# p.plot_surface(X, Y, np.ones((N,N)) * 0.5, alpha=0.2)
ax.set_xlabel('x1')
ax.set_ylabel('x2')
ax.set_zlabel('x3')
ax.set_title('Figure 2')
# ax.azim = 80
ax.elev = 70

ax.scatter(2,3,1,c='r')
# Plot a surface

X, Y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(0, 1, 0.1) * 2, np.arange(0, 1, 0.1) * 3)
p.plot_surface(X, Y, np.ones((N,N)) * 0.5, alpha=0.2)
ax.set_xlabel('x1')
ax.set_ylabel('x2')
ax.set_zlabel('x3')
ax.set_title('Figure 3')
# ax.azim = 80
ax.elev = 30

The same set of points is plotted in the figures above. In figure 1 we are looking at the dataset "from above". Figures 2 and 3 are the "tilted" version of figure 1, but we have added a feature, the third dimension. Now it's easy to classify points, look there is even a plane clearly dividing the set in two!

Is this the solution to all our classification problems? No unfortunately. If we add too many dimensions, we seriously risk to **overfit** our data.

## Down to Business
As mentioned, support vector machines (SVMs) allow us to solve classification problems (as well as regression problems in fact). If we have a set of points, and two labels , for example **0** and **1** (or **good**, **bad**), we want to label the next observed point as being a **0** or a **1**.

Linear SVMs separate the input data by finding an hyperplane between them such that the orthogonal distance between the plane and the closest point is maximized. Almost like in figure 3 above, but better, in an optimal, algorithmic way. Non Linear SVMs find non linear boundaries to separate subsets of points into classes (our labels).

The problem of finding such hyperplane (or hypersurface in the non linear case) in an optimal way can be solved by optimization methods. One possibility is to fomalize the optimization as <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_programming'>quadratic problem</a>. This is perhaps the core of the SVM machinery, but it's also a whole chapter in itself. Discussing such algorithms would take us very far, so we defer the discussion (hopefully) to future posts. 

To recap, the main ingredients that we need are the labeled dataset to train the SVM, a kernel and an optimization method. We can use well established python modules for our SVMs.
