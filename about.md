I'm Gabriele. I have a passion for science and learning new things. Here I collect ideas, scripts and memos, mostly to have a scratchpad, without the pretension to write the ultimate piece of scientific literature.
<br><br>
 Why would I need that? It's fun to try new things, sometimes far from my education area, so when I do something new, or I want to try something, I write it down to fix the ideas.  Sometimes when you're stuck it's often those two lines of code that solve the problem, or you just need a practical example to understand how the pieces go together.
